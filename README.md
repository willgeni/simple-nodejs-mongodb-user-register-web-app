# Simple User Register Web-App

Welcome to the Simple User Register Web-App! This project is a web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to manage user information. The application allows users to register, view, update, and delete their details, including uploading and displaying profile images.

## Project Description

This web application provides a straightforward system for managing user data. It leverages Node.js and Express for the backend and MongoDB with Mongoose for database management. The frontend is designed with EJS for templating. Users can register with their name, email, phone number, and profile picture. The app supports CRUD operations and includes search, sorting, and pagination features.

### Key Features

- **User Registration**: Add new users with their details and profile pictures.
- **User Listing**: View a list of registered users with their information and images.
- **User Updates**: Edit existing user details and update their profile pictures.
- **User Deletion**: Remove users from the system.
- **Search and Sort**: Search users by name and sort the list by different criteria.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large sets of user data with pagination controls.

## Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coderooz/simple-nodejs-mongodb-user-register-web-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd simple-nodejs-mongodb-user-register-web-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Make sure MongoDB is available:**

   You need one of these before starting the app:

   - A local MongoDB server listening on `127.0.0.1:27017`
   - Docker Desktop with Docker Compose installed and running

5. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/registerApp
   PORT=5500
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will run on `http://localhost:5500`.

### Run with Docker

If Docker Desktop is installed and running, start both the app and MongoDB with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:5500`.

If `docker-compose` is not recognized on your machine, install Docker Desktop first or use the local MongoDB route above.
